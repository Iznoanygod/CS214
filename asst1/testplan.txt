The directory testfiles contains all files used to test fileCompressor. The structure of testfiles is as follows:
testfiles/hamlet.txt
testfiles/additional/macbeth.txt
testfiles/additional/romeo.txt
The program was tested by first running it in non recursive mode, first building the codebook using hamlet.txt
The given codebook was used to compress hamlet.txt and then decompress the given hamlet.txt.hcz
The commands for these tests were
>./fileCompressor -b testfiles/hamlet.txt
>./fileCompressor -c testfiles/hamlet.txt HuffmanCodebook
>./fileCompressor -d testfiles/hamlet.txt.hcz HuffmanCodebook
Then it was time to test the recursive mode for the program
First, I removed the existing codebook
>rm HuffmanCodebook
Then, I tested the recursive mode similarly to how I tested the non recursive mode
>./fileCompressor -R -b testfiles
>./fileCompressor -R -c testfiles
This compressed all .txt files in the testfiles directory and subdirectories.
Then, to see that the the program does decompress the files properly, we need to remove the .txt files then decompress
>mv testfiles/hamlet.txt testfiles/hamlet.txt.bak
>mv testfiles/additional/macbeth.txt testfiles/additional/macbeth.txt.bak
>mv testfiles/additional/romeo.txt testfiles/additional/romeo.txt.bak
>./fileCompressor -R -d testfiles
The output .txt files can be compared against the .txt.bak files that the files were moved to. This verifies that recursive decompress works properly.
