Test Plan

Our tester runs through probable scenarios for points of failure with multiple clients and checks the stdout of each client to make sure
that each error (or success) is dealt with appropriately by the server.

Usage: ./WTFtest [test document] [temporary stdout ABSOLUTE path]

Argument 1 is the location of the document containing the tests. The format for this document is:
	- [client command]\t[expected output]\n
	- There is special formatting available for the [expected output]
		- * = pass output to stdout and let user decide if the result passed
		- # = ignore expected output (for things like system commands)

Argument 2 is an ABSOLUTE location that can be used as temporary storage for stdout. Note, you must include the file name, any will do.

For example, to run our testcases the full usage is:
	1. ./WTFserver 25585
	2. ./WTFtest tests.txt /ilab/users/[your username]/tempstdout
	3. Ctrl+C server
	4. rm -rf clients/ proj1/ .projects	(to clear files generated from the test, cannot be done while server is running)
