Test Plan

testgenerator
	- Utility to create test cases for integer and string data files
	- For string files
		- We take advantage of the dictionary file located at "/usr/share/dict/words".
		- We read in BUFF_SIZE bytes starting at a random byte location in the file,
		  parse out 1 word, store the word in a node in a linked list then repeat
		  for the desired number of tokens.
		- We then write the linked list to a comma separated file and mix in some
		  escape characters such as "\n" or "\t".
	- For integer files
		- We generate a random number and store it in a node in a linked list.
		- Repeat for the desired number of tokens.
		- We then write the linked list to a comma separated file and mix in some
		  escape characters such as "\n" or "\t".

Testing Process
	1. Generate a test file
	2. Test fileSort on the generated test file
	3. Verify results

What We Were Testing For
	1. Escape characters
	2. Empty tokens
	3. Very large data file size
	4. Empty data file
	5. General sorting accuracy
	6. Data file with all same tokens
	7. Data file with negative numbers
